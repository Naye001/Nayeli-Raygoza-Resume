        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I graduated from Banning High School in 2022,and now I am currently enrolled as a full time student at the University of California Riverside. I am a freshman looking to major in Business. My expected graduation year is 2026. I currently work part time, despite being a full time student. In highschool I was involved in multiple clubs, like Spanish club. I was also in marching band, orchestra, and soccer. In soccer I had the opportunity to be a team captain for a couple of years. I am extremely greteful of this because as a shy person, it led me to expand my leadership skills and made me become more open with myself and others. <br><br>
        I am a first generation college student with immigrant parents from Mexico. I am also the oldest out of my siblings. Growing up, I was the first to do anything and had to discover most things on my own. This allowed me to develop research skills and become more independent. As of right now I have had two jobs. My first one was last year in August. It was at an outlet in the store Journeys. At the time I had a second job which is Fast5Express Car Wash. This went on for a while until my first quarter of college was about to start. Once it did start, I ultimately decided to only work at Fast5Express as I found that it allowed me to enhance my communication skills a lot more.  <br><br>

        Some of my hobbies include discovering music, playing soccer, and reading. My current musical obsessions would be Maneskin, Fleetwood Mac, and other classic rock bands. Two of my favorite books would include "Song of Achilles" and "Six of Crows".
        I am currently challenging myself by teaching myself how to play the Piano and getting better with my Spanish despite being fluent. For the piano, a short term milestone would be to learn how to play Sleeping Lotus by Joep Beving. In high school I played soccer all my four years and was also captain. Now I like participating in Rodeos with my dad. This year I would like to further challenge myself by learning to better manage my time and lead a more mentally and physically active lifestyle. A goal that I have set for the end of the year would be to take up a new hobby and start learning Italian.
